                <h3>Why am I a Computer Engineer?</h3>
                <p>
                    From a young age, I have always been fascinated by technology and the intricate world of electricity.
                    The idea that a simple electrical signal could transform into the software we use every day captivated my imagination.
                    This early interest was nurtured in my 6th grade computer class, where my teacher challenged us to think about our future paths and careers.
                    She encouraged us to start considering what we wanted to achieve and how we could make a meaningful impact in the world.
                    Inspired by her words, I realized that I wanted to create, innovate, and contribute to society through technology.
                    I aspired to be part of the ever-evolving tech landscape, to not only understand the complexities behind it but to also leave a mark through my contributions.
                    This passion and drive ultimately led me to pursue a career in computer engineering, where I am dedicated to advancing the field and being recognized for my efforts.

                <h3>Future Advances</h3>
                <p>
                    During high school, I seized the opportunity to further immerse myself in the technology field by joining a specialized program called the Academy of Information Technology (AOIT).
                    This program was instrumental in shaping my understanding and skills in various aspects of technology.
                    One of my most memorable achievements during this time was building my own gaming PC, which I still use to this day.
                    This project not only honed my hardware skills but also deepened my appreciation for the intricacies of computer systems.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Through AOIT, I delved into the world of computer networks and internet systems, gaining valuable insights into how these technologies connect and drive our digital lives.
                    The program also introduced me to basic webpage building, where I learned the fundamentals of creating and designing websites.
                    Additionally, I explored operating systems, understanding how they function as the backbone of all computer operations.
                    One of the highlights of my AOIT experience was taking basic Python development classes, which sparked my interest in programming and software development.

                <br>
                <p>
                    These experiences collectively laid a strong foundation for my future in computer engineering.
                    They equipped me with a diverse set of skills and a profound understanding of technology, preparing me for the challenges and innovations of the tech world.
                    My time at AOIT was a pivotal period of growth and exploration, solidifying my commitment to advancing in the field of computer engineering.

                <h3>College Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    In college, I had the opportunity to significantly expand my knowledge and skills through a diverse array of courses and hands-on experiences.
                    I delved into digital circuit design and analog circuit design, gaining a comprehensive understanding of how electronic components function and interact.
                    These courses provided me with the foundational knowledge necessary to design and analyze complex circuits.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My coursework also included program planning and design, which honed my ability to create efficient and effective software solutions.
                    Through algorithmic analysis and utilization, I learned how to develop and implement algorithms to solve various computational problems.
                    These skills are essential for any aspiring computer engineer, as they form the backbone of software development and optimization.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In addition to these core subjects, I took an electronics class that offered practical insights into the functioning and application of electronic devices.
                    My studies in calculus, spanning all three levels, equipped me with the mathematical tools needed to tackle complex engineering problems.
                    The multiple physics classes I attended further deepened my understanding of the physical principles that underpin technology and engineering.
